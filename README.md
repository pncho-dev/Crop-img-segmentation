This repository contains the segmentation algorithms used to 
segmentate the rice crops in pictures taken from a dron nearby Cali, Colombia. 

The most simple aproach takes into account few images and non-complex filters aplied to RGB images of 320*240. More complex algorithms use the corresponding thermal image of RGB image to segmentate the crops using the temperature registered of each pixel.

The images where captured using a thermal camera FLIR DUO R which allow to extract the RGB and thermal image. In the repository i uploaded some images that were used to tune and implement the algorithms.
